## 🚀 Quick Start

Each skill category has its own README with setup instructions. The general pattern:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/singlegrain/ai-marketing-skills.git
cd ai-marketing-skills

# 2. Pick a category
cd growth-engine  # or sales-pipeline, content-ops, etc.

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# 5. Run
python experiment-engine.py create \
  --hypothesis "Thread posts get 2x engagement vs single posts" \
  --variable format \
  --variants '["thread", "single"]' \
  --metric impressions
```

## 🧠 How These Work with Claude Code

Every category includes a `SKILL.md` file. Drop it into your Claude Code project and the AI agent knows how to use the tools:

```
# In your project directory
cp ai-marketing-skills/growth-engine/SKILL.md .claude/skills/growth-engine.md
```

Then ask Claude Code: *"Run an experiment testing carousel vs. static posts on LinkedIn"* — it handles the rest.

## 📊 What Makes These Different

**These aren't toy demos.** Each skill was built to run real business operations:

- **Growth Engine** uses bootstrap confidence intervals and Mann-Whitney U tests — real statistics, not vibes
- **Deal Resurrector** has three intelligence layers including "follow the champion" — tracking departed contacts to their new companies
- **ICP Learner** rewrites your ideal customer profile based on actual win/loss data — your targeting improves automatically
- **Expert Panel** recursively scores content with domain-specific expert personas until quality hits 90+
- **RB2B Router** does intent scoring, seniority-based company dedup, and agency classification before routing to outbound sequences
